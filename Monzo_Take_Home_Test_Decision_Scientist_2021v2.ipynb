We expect you to complete the notebook with insightful analysis, elegant code and clear documentation of your findings (perfectly OK to embed within this notebook, just make sure using a distinct color). Please also feel free to keep in the final notebook any code+result where you believe there is value, even if it's not directly addressing the questions below.\n",

Once a customer reaches a status of missing 4 payments, we marked them as 'D' which means it has defaulted. For simplicity let's assume it as a terminal status and all the following records will be 'D' as well. \n",
